# Tridex
This modification is based on the official Voron Trident release files: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident/releases/tag/Trident

It adds:

-350x250mm frame for use with 250x250mm build plate

-IDEX toolheads

-2040/4040 frame with EZBake front door for additional insulation

-Updated front skirt files for flush appearance with door

All files are in "alpha" state--functional, but not optimized. Use them at your own risk, no support is implied :)
